            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>Hello, I'm Mohammed Amaan Ur Rahman. I'm an IT-focused Computer Science engineer from SRM University KTR Chennai in India. Before enrolling in the Masters program (ITM) at Illinois Institute of Technology, I also worked as an information technology intern at Shaker Group KSA. I've had the chance to work on projects like Plant Disease Detection Using AI & ML algorithms and Crypto Currency Price Prediction using ML Algorithms. In addition to this, I like to play Table Tennis and I have represented India at the International Level. Throughout my Masters program, I'm eager to pick up new skills, and I'm looking forward to getting to know and work with other enthusiasts here.</p>
